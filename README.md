This library simply wraps `com.auth0:java-jwt` so that you can easily use `JSON Web Token` with little to no 
configuration.

Through the `cn.vorbote.simplejwt.AccessKeyUtil` class of the class library, after completing the required key and 
issuer of the JWT, you can use various simple methods in the class to create `JSON Web Token`.

> The library is now in **_ALPHA_** test, if you could want to help us to test, you could clone this library and use 
> **maven** or **gradle** to build it to your local repository. If you found any bugs or have any question while using 
> it, please do not hesitate to contact us by submitting an **issue** with the situation you met. If you are able to
> fix or improve that problem on your own, we are also welcome your **Pull Request**.
